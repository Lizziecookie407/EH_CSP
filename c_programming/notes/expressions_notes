/*
What is the difference between an integer and a float in C?
 integer is a whole number, float is a decimal
How does C handle integer division compared to float division?
 all division is integer devision
List the arithmetic operators available in C and their functions.
 + addition - subtraction / devision * multiplication % modulo(remainder)
What is the modulus operator, and how is it used?
 % it gets the remainer from devision
How do you round a float to the nearest integer in C?
 convert the float to an intiger and it will round it
What is type casting in C?
 saying what type of data it is when you are using it
What is the purpose of the math.h library? Name three functions it provides.
 it give you extra funtions to use. pow(x,y)
How do you print a float with a specific number of decimal places using printf()?
 write X.X for the digits before and after the decimal point that it will print
What happens when you mix integer and float operations in C?
 the outcome will always be a float

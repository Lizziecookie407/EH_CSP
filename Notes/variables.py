# EH 6th Varables Notes

#One way to have your program give an output is a print statement in python. It sends all the information inside of parentheses to the terminal. Use quotation marks if it is words. It does not print the parentheses or quotation marks.
#A variable is a container. You have to label it something that actually makes sense for what it holds.
#I assign a variable by stating it equals something.
#I reassign a variable by saying it is something else. It will replace it with the new thing.
#I create an input into my program by saying input and asking something inside parentheses for the user to answer.
#You can have infinite things in the same print statement but every item needs to be separated with comments.

#Variable
subject = "CSP"
pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751
color = "blue" 

print(pi)

#snake_case (all lower case, replace space with underscore)
baseball_team = "Red Sox"
#camelCase (no spaces, first letter of all words exept the first are capitalized)
baseballTeam = "Pirates"
#PascalCase (capitalize first of every word, no spaces)
BaseballTeam = "Giants"

#reassign a variable
pi = 3.14159265

pi = "French Silk"
pi = "Pumpkin"
print(pi)

# input
name = input("What is your name? ")
color = input("What is your favoie color?\n")

quest = input("What is your quest: ")

print("What is your favorite animal?")
answer = input()

print("Your name is",name,"this is",subject,"the best pi is",pi,"the best color is",color,)

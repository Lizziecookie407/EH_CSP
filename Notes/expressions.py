#EH 6th Expressions Notes

#What is an algorithm? 
    #A set of instructions to amcomplish a task. it will work every time and do the exact same steps.
#List steps in an algorithm: 
    #1) determine what variables/peices of into you need. 2) prosesses info. 3) provide output.
#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
    #+ add, - subtract, * multiply, / devide, ** exponents, //integer division, % modulo(remainder), 
#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
    #
#Why are expressions so important in programming?
    #
# an expressison is a collection of numbers and symbols to get a result.
